SAPOS require an user to login.

There are two ways to deal with user creation in SAPOS:

1 - If your database is empty and you already made all migrations, don't worry, just log in and this user will be registered automatically.
    This procedure will always occur if your 'Users' table is empty.

2 - It is possible to register a new User using IRB console. IRB console is accessible by typing the command "Rails c".
    The password of this newly created user, will be hashed automatically
    Example: @u = User.new(:name => "admin", :password => "123456"); @u.save!
